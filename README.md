# Coffee

This Android app provides a tile in the quick settings (the place that holds the toggles for e.g. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) that allows you to keep the display awake without having to change the device settings.

Android 7 or higher is required.

## Translations

You can help translating this app by coping the file `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` to `app/src/main/res/values-xx/strings.xml` (`xx` stands for your language code), removing all entries marked with `translatable="false"` and translating the remaining entries. This file contains all strings used in the app.

The app store description can also be translated: Copy `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/full_description.txt` and `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/short_description.txt` to `fastlane/metadata/android/xx-YY/full_description.txt` (`xx` is the language code, `YY` is the country code) and translate the file.
